# GAN-playground
A repository containing GAN projects.

Environment: `Python3` `PyTorch`

# Motivation
A curiosity and interest of the exciting field of Generative adversarial network has lead to the creation of this repository. The intention is to add content as more projects are explored. 
Style transfer is the first project implemented and the is based on an assignment from StanfordCS class CS231n [link](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2019/assignment3/).
